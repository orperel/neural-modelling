===================
Known issues:
===================

Model:
------
1) Modifiers should include start & end tokens ("create new doc with cube prior", "close doc").
2) No weight between various loss components
3) Selected elements should always be represented by a single pos?
4) NoisyPrimitivesDataset contains max_len=2048 for modifier encodings, is this really needed?

Mesh simplification:
--------------------
1) Contract Pair produces holes for lego model
2) Split Vertex relies on false logic, when reconnecting edges to the 2 new vertices, we shouldn't connect
to the closest one to each vertex, that yields a bad mesh.

Graphics:
-----------
1) Polygons are not always CW (backfacing)
2) Rendering requires proper lighting
3) Loaded obj should be scaled to normalized range

Inference:
-----------
1) Soft select Logic is naive in terms of complexity (use KD tree)
2)* (with Model: Selected elements should always be represented by a single pos?)


===================
Tasks
===================

Infrastructure:
----------------
1) No test dataloader employed during training
2) Network weights + loss + images should be hooked into Tensorboard
